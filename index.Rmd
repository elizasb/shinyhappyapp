## Introduction
* There is burgeoning interest in **happiness** being just as important of a metric as GDP. 
* The World Happiness Report 2016 Update provides a CSV file of data for 156 countries from 2005-2015 (non-exhaustive).
* The goal of this project is to present this data in an interactive form.

## Methods
In 2015, the country with the highest Happiness Index ("Life.Ladder")
was Norway (7.6) and the lowest was Liberia (2.7).

To understand the relationship between happiness and other metrics, the following steps were taken: 
1. Pre-process data (import into R, merge w/ global region dataset, etc.) 
2. Perform exploratory analysis (e.g. summary, etc.) 
3. Create interactive charts using GoogleVis package 

Summary for 2005-2015:
```{r echo=FALSE}
#library(xtable)
file_csv<-"data_whr2016.csv"
df<- read.csv(file_csv)
summary(df[,c(4,5,7)])
#df2015<-df[df$year==2015,c(2:4)]
#df2 <- df2015[order(-df2015$Life.Ladder),] 
```

## Interactive Chart
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'asis'}
require(googleVis)
M1 <- gvisMotionChart(df, idvar = "country", timevar = "year")
plot(M1, tag = 'chart')
```

## Next Steps
* Incorporate multivariate regression for modeling happiness as a function of 
country-level variables (e.g. GDP, life expectancy, etc.)
* Add parallel coordinate plot to visualize the relationship between variables
* Include additional country-level indices (http://index.gain.org/, etc.)
* Explore finer spatial resolution datasets (state, county level) and sentiment analysis from social media
